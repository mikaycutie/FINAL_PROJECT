This program is a simple Sales Analysis Tool implemented in Java. It uses a menu-based system powered by JOptionPane to manage and analyze sales data. Users can perform operations such as adding sales data, calculating maximum and minimum sales, and simulating file saving/loading operations.

Add Sales Data: Input and store sales amounts dynamically.
Calculate Max Sales: Find the highest sales amount from the entered data.
Calculate Min Sales: Find the lowest sales amount from the entered data.
Save Sales Data to File: Mock implementation that simulates saving data to a file.
Load Sales Data from File: Mock implementation that simulates loading data from a file.
Exit: Closes the application.
